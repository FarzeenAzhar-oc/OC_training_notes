## What is a container?
- A way to package applications with all the necessary dependencies and configurations
- Protable artifacts, easly shared and moved arounf
- Makes dev and dep more effecient.


 ## Storage of containers
 - Stored in cintainer repositories
 - Private/public repositories (DockerHub)

## Pros of containers for dev
### Before containers
1. Every devoleper had to install all dependecies with required configuration
2. Installation process different on each OS enviroment
3. Many steo where something could go wrong.

### After containers 
1. Own isolated env
2. Packaged with all needed configuration
3. One command to install ap
4. Run same app with 2 diff versions of OS 

## Pros of containers for dep
### Before
1. Everything required need to be configured
2. Chances for misunderstanding

### After container 
1. Devolepers and operations work together to package the app in a container
2. No env dependencis except for docker
