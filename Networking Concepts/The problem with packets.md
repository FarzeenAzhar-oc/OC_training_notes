- IP describes how to split messages into packets and send those packets to destination via hops
- But IP doesn't handle all consequences of packets, like:
	- Which packet belongs to which message when multiple messages are send
	- Out of order packets
	- Corruption of packets
	- Loss of packets
	- Duplication of packets due to accidental retransmission
- Higher level protocoles on top of IP helps, like [TCP](TCP.md) and [UDP](UDP.md)
