- Helps to tremendously reduce runtime
- Replicate everything
- Replicas are also connected to a service, service also acts like a load balancer
- Replicas are ccreated by giving a blueprint of the pod and specifying how many replicas you would like to run
- This blueprint is called **Deployment**
- **Deployment** is an abstraction on top of pods that makes it easier to replicate and work with them, like the pods are an abstraction on nods
- Databases can't be replicated using Deployment cause they have states.
- **Statefulset** helps to replicate and work with databases by helping to synchronise data and such
- Working with statefulset is hard, so dbs are put outside k8s cluster in practice.
