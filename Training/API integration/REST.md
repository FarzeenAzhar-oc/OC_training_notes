- Webpage split into multiple small small API chunks
- Each API is connected to a resource using URI(Uniform resource Identfier)
- When the API is triggered , only the resource is sent from server
- HTTP is unstructured, hence we use JSON , XMl etc format in REST to send and recieve data
- REST is stateless (at application level), hence any server can manage
