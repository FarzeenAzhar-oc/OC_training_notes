- Take the case when while in use a **pod** dies. This causes downtime.
- Hence instead of relying on one application the pods are replicatedas a backup against crash
- They are connected to the same service. Hence service has 2 functionalitie:
	- Providing permenant IP 
	- load balancer, by catching a request and sending it to whicher pod is less busy.
- Replicas are made using **deployments**
- **Deployment** are :
	- Blue print for an pods
	- Deployments are created instead of pods
	- Deployment are abstractions on top of pods which makes it more convineant to interact with pods , replicate them etc
	- In practice, one mostly works with deployments rather than pods.
## Stateful set
- Used to replicate containers that have some state, like databases.
- **StatefulSet** state helps all replicas of db to share the same datastorage, manage which pods are reading an writing from a storage in order to avoid data inconsistancies.
- Deploying db apps using stateFul set is somewhat tedious, hence it's commen practice to host Db outside k8s cluster.
