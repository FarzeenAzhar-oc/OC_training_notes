- Layers: Hardware -> OS Kernal -> App
- Both docker and VS are virtualisation tools:
	- Docker Virtualises Application layer
	- VM virtualises kernal and App layer=> whole OS
- Implication:
	- Docker has lesser size
	- Dockers have more speed
	- Kernal campatibility matters for docker images and not for VM
